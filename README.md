### Description

This project is a personal portfolio built with TypeScript and Angular. 
The goal of this project was to explore new technologies beyond my usual 
.NET and to take advantage of the benefits offered by Angular for building dynamic and responsive web applications. 
Additionally, I wanted to deploy this portfolio on GitHub Pages, which is well-suited for static sites and not ideal for .NET applications.

### Why Angular and TypeScript?

I chose Angular and TypeScript for this project because:

- Angular provides a robust framework for building scalable and maintainable web applications.
- TypeScript offers type safety, which helps catch errors early and improves code quality.
- I wanted to learn and experiment with these technologies to broaden my skill set.
- GitHub Pages is ideal for hosting static sites, and Angular can be compiled into a static site easily.


### Experimental Workflows and CI/CD

In addition to being a personal portfolio, this project also serves as a playground for experimenting with different workflows, build pipelines, and YAML configurations. Iâ€™m using it to try out new techniques in Continuous Integration/Continuous Deployment (CI/CD) and to refine my understanding of automated processes within software development. This hands-on experimentation allows me to better understand the integration of various tools and methodologies.
