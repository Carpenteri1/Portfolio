  As a .NET developer with almost 3 years of experience, I have worked on several projects with significant
  responsibility in the development process.<br><br>

  One of my most significant achievements was working on a website for a customer of Andre med v√§nner. My
  colleague,
  a UX designer, and I collaborated on developing the website, including creating a custom CMS. The CMS
  allowed
  the
  customer to log in with a crypted password and have the ability to change text, images, layout, and add or
  remove
  webpages. The CMS project was then connected to the main page, making it easy for the customer to manage
  their
  website.<br><br>

  I have also worked on several projects for Techstep, where I was responsible for developing apps in Xamarin
  and
  Android for big names in the industris of public transport, courier and mail,transport and logistics.
  Been on both backend and frontend development, but my focus has mostly been on frontend development. My
  duties
  included
  developing functions, layouts, looking at error logs, bug fixing, handling different events with Docker and
  Rancher, and delivering excellent solutions to our customers. My team and I also maintained close contact
  with
  customers and planned workflows using Scrum and Agile methodologies.<br><br>

  I am proud of my work on one of our clients in logistics, they gave me complete responsibility for
  developing a solution
  that
  allowed customers to track pallets with materials by scanning barcodes and RFID tags using their phones. The
  solution connected to a back-office database, enabling users to track all the relevant data.<br><br>

  As a passionate and driven developer, I enjoy creating solutions using cutting-edge technology. While my
  main
  focus is .NET development, I am always keen to explore new technologies and frameworks as long as they
  relate to
  my work with .NET. I look forward to bringing my skills and experience to new challenges and opportunities
  in
  the future.
