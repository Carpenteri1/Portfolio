            As a .NET developer with almost 3 years of experience, I have worked on several projects with significant
            responsibility in the development process. My technical skills include knowledge of dotnet core and
            framework,
            C#,
            REST-API, SQL, T-SQL, JavaScript, HTML, CSS, Blazer, MVC, Xamarin, Java, and Android.<br><br>

            One of my most significant achievements was working on a website for a customer of Andre med v√§nner. My
            colleague,
            a UX designer, and I collaborated on developing the website, including creating a custom CMS. The CMS
            allowed
            the
            customer to log in with a crypted password and have the ability to change text, images, layout, and add or
            remove
            webpages. The CMS project was then connected to the main page, making it easy for the customer to manage
            their
            website.<br><br>

            I have also worked on several projects for Techstep, where I was responsible for developing apps in Xamarin
            and
            Android for big names in the industris of public transport, courier and mail,transport and logistics.
            Been on both backend and frontend development, but my focus has mostly been on frontend development. My
            duties
            included
            developing functions, layouts, looking at error logs, bug fixing, handling different events with Docker and
            Rancher, and delivering excellent solutions to our customers. My team and I also maintained close contact
            with
            customers and planned workflows using Scrum and Agile methodologies.<br><br>

            I am proud of my work on one of our clients in logistics, they gave me complete responsibility for
            developing a solution
            that
            allowed customers to track pallets with materials by scanning barcodes and RFID tags using their phones. The
            solution connected to a back-office database, enabling users to track all the relevant data.<br><br>

            As a passionate and driven developer, I enjoy creating solutions using cutting-edge technology. While my
            main
            focus is .NET development, I am always keen to explore new technologies and frameworks as long as they
            relate to
            my work with .NET. I look forward to bringing my skills and experience to new challenges and opportunities
            in
            the future.
